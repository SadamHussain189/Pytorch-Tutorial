    "* Building models with the neural network layers and functions of the torch.nn module\n",
    "* The mechanics of automated gradient computation, which is central to gradient-based model training\n",
    "* Using TensorBoard to visualize training progress and other activities\n",

    "In this video, we'll be adding some new tools to your inventory:\n",
    "* We'll get familiar with the dataset and dataloader abstractions, and how they ease the process of feeding data to your model during a training loop\n",
    "* We'll discuss specific loss functions and when to use them\n",
    "* We'll look at PyTorch optimizers, which implement algorithms to adjust model weights based on the outcome of a loss function\n",

    "Finally, we'll pull all of these together and see a full PyTorch training loop in action."

    "The `Dataset` and `DataLoader` classes encapsulate the process of pulling your data from storage and exposing it to your training loop in batches.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Dataset` is responsible for accessing and processing single instances of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `DataLoader` pulls instances of data from the `Dataset` (either automatically or with a sampler that you define), collects them in batches, and returns them for consumption by your training loop. The `DataLoader` works with all kinds of datasets, regardless of the type of data they contain.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we'll be using the Fashion-MNIST dataset provided by TorchVision. We use `torchvision.transforms.Normalize()` to zero-center and normalize the distribution of the image tile content, and download both training and validation data splits.\n"
