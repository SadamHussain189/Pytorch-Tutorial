    "\n",
    "Most binary operations on tensors will return a third, new tensor. When we say `c = a * b` (where `a` and `b` are tensors), the new tensor `c` will occupy a region of memory distinct from the other tensors.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are times, though, that you may wish to alter a tensor in place - for example, if you're doing an element-wise computation where you can discard intermediate values. For this, most of the math functions have a version with an appended underscore (`_`) that will alter a tensor in place.\n",
